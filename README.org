* Custom tooling for 3D visuals
  HOTSOUP is my attempt at a personal take on the kind of custom tooling that demoscene
  creators build up to create their works. I make no claim to any of the techniques I employ
  in developing this tooling necessarily being "best practices", nor any promise of backwards
  compatibility from commit to commit - this is simply a virtual sketchbook for me to make
  stuff I think is cool, and learn as I go along. I also am not taking into account the kind of
  limitations that many demoscene creators impose on themselves at this point - all I care
  about is that the output of this program is reasonably performant on the hardware I want to
  target, which for right now is anything that can run OpenGL ES 3.x (specific version
  undecided at the moment).

** Relevant languages/libraries/standards
   - C++
   - GLFW3
   - OpenAL
   - OpenGL ES 3.x
   - Probably more to come, honestly
** Current goals
   - [ ] Scripted dependency retrieval for Debian 11 Bullseye
   - [ ] 100% compatibility running GLSL shaders from [[https://www.shadertoy.com/][Shadertoy]], locally
	 (including texture layers)
   - [ ] DSL/command line interface for interactive programming
   - [ ] Emacs integration
** Targeted platforms
   Right now, desktop Linux is the targeted platform for development, with the technologies
   the whole thing is built on hopefully being cross platform enough for building and running
   graphical programs created with it on Windows and macOS for cases where a free operating
   system just isn't as viable as a locked down spyware platform that can run Photoshop and FL
   Studio.
   One possibility I'd like to experiment with is converting OpenGL ES programs into webGL
   with [[https://emscripten.org/][emscripten]], possibly skirting around cross-platform friction completely by running
   in a web browser, but this is down the line.
